# HackBus

Transactional memory bridge to Modbus RTU. Expandable to other buses such as DMX.

Uses Haskell Software Transactional Memory to translate imperative nature of field buses to declarative definition.

Still work in progress, but used in daily basis at Hacklab Jyväskylä club room for controlling lighting and power sockets.

## Installation

TODO improve installation instructions.

```
sudo apt install cabal libghc-stm-dev libmodbus-dev
cabal update
```
